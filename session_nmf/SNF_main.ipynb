    "> Given the expression data of genome elements, we first extract multiple expression features for each regulatory element based on the heterogeneous biological networks. Based on the extracted feature matrices of samples, we use a matrix correlation method, RV2, to predict the similarities between samples in each expression data-view, and then fuse the similarity information in samples from all considering data-views according to different integration weights. Finally, we cluster patient samples into different cancer subtypes based on the predicted integrative similarity network between samples."
